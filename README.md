## Introduction

The Car Spec and Rental Web App backend is built using the Spring Boot framework, which provides a robust and efficient platform for developing Java-based web applications. It serves as the foundation for the Car Spec and Rental Web App frontend, handling the business logic, data storage, and communication with the frontend.

## Features

The main features of the Car Spec and Rental Web App backend include:

- RESTful APIs: The backend provides a set of RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with, enabling functionalities such as car specification retrieval, rental booking, user authentication, and admin dashboard management.
- Data storage: The backend integrates with a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve car specifications, rental information, user details, and other relevant data.
- Security: The backend implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authenticated users can access protected resources and perform authorized actions.
- Integration: The backend can integrate with external services or APIs (e.g., payment gateways, mapping services) to enhance the functionality of the web application.
